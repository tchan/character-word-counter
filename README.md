# Character and Word Counter for Titles

This is a simple app that lets you know how many characters/words are in your phrase! Remember that the ideal numbers are 8-14 word headlines AND 80 characters or fewer, otherwise some bits may be cut off. 

> How long should your headline be? HubSpot [analyzed](http://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/seo-social-media-study#sm.00000z83pnwr7kdwxvrrsinzxyr7l) 6,000 blog posts and found that stories with **8 to 14-word headlines** get more social  media shares.
This said, make sure your headline is **80 characters** or fewer. Otherwise, the title will get truncated in news feeds when people share your article on Facebook and Twitter.
